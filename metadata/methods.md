Beginning in 2023, data collection was transitioned to the DataTackle data collection application. The transition resulted in differences in data format from historical paper fieldsheet based data collection. All data collected previous to DataTackle  are included in this EDI data package: 
Revnak, R. 2024. Monitoring juvenile Chinook salmon outmigration using rotary screw traps on Deer and Mill creeks ver 3. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/352f39bd3c2836c3d88035743675487b.

# Trap equipment

A single 5-foot diameter rotary screw trap RST operated on each creek. 

# Current trap location

Mill Creek: Upper Dam on Mill Creek, located approximately 6 river-miles from the confluence with the Sacramento River near the town of Los Molinos, California.

Deer Creek: Deer Creek RST is located approximately 9.5 river-miles from the confluence of the Sacramento River near the town of Vina, California.

# Monitoring schedule

October through June.

Continuously trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions.

Serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch.

# Daily environmental data

Water temperature (Celsius)

Flow (cubic feet per second)

# Fish measurements

Fork length measurements to the nearest mm are taken for: Chinook salmon: 10 randomly selected; Non-salmonid fish: first 10 (fork length measurement).

# Fish counts

All fish not measured are plus counted by hand.

# Trap efficiency trials

Hatchery-origin juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon from Coleman National Fish Hatchery are used for efficiency trials.

Trials are conducted bi-weekly from February to May across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals allow. 

A minimum of seven consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for a release to be included in analyses.

Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible.  

Release site located approximately 1 mile upstream of the trapping site.

# Trap efficiency mark 

Fish are marked with Bismarck Brown Y (BBY) whole body stain.
